# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explains the process of Requirement Analysis in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).
It includes key concepts, examples, and diagrams to help understand how to gather, document, and validate software requirements effectively.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, analyzing, and documenting the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software project.
It serves as the foundation for all subsequent phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), ensuring that the final product aligns with business goals and user needs.

Importance:

Ensures clear understanding between stakeholders and developers.

Helps prevent scope creep and miscommunication.

Defines a clear project scope and goals.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Prevents Miscommunication: Ensures developers and stakeholders share the same understanding of project goals.

Improves Quality: A clear set of requirements leads to software that meets user expectations.

Saves Time and Cost: Early identification of requirements reduces rework later in development.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
Requirement Gathering: Collecting stakeholder needs via interviews, surveys, and workshops.

Requirement Elicitation: Refining and clarifying gathered requirements using brainstorming or prototyping.

Requirement Documentation: Recording requirements in formal documents or models.

Requirement Analysis and Modeling: Structuring and analyzing requirements to ensure feasibility and completeness.

Requirement Validation: Reviewing requirements with stakeholders to confirm accuracy and completeness.

## Types of Requirements
Functional Requirements
These describe what the system should do.
Examples (Booking Management System):

Users can register and log in securely.

Admins can manage property listings.

Customers can search for available properties and make bookings.

Non-functional Requirements
These describe how the system should perform.
Examples:

The system should load pages within 2 seconds.

Data must be encrypted during transactions.

The platform should be able to handle up to 10,000 simultaneous users.

## Use Case Diagrams
Use Case Diagrams show how users (actors) interact with the system. They help visualize system functionality and relationships.

Actors:
Customer

Admin

Property Owner

Use Cases:
Register/Login

Search Property
